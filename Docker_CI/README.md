# Docker_CI

In this template we will make docker image from dockerfile present on the gitgub . We can also say setup automation build in dockerhub . All you need to do is just follow the steps in the following:

# Step 1 : 
            Open your github and fork this repository .
# Step 2: 
            You should have you Pro, Team or Business docker account . Create the repo with any name on the dockerhub . 
# Step 3: 
            Open the repo that you have created , click on the build section and then select link to github option .
# Step 4: 
            Add your github username and then add repo name (where the dockerfile in present ) .
# Step 5: 
            Then in autotest section , select the internal pull request (At every push , image will start create automatically).
            Off the repository link . 
# Step 6: 
            In the last , just set the branch name , in which you want to use in automated test build. And then click on save and build .
# Step 7: 
            It will take sometime and will create docker image from dockerfile present on the github . Whenever there is some change in the the dockerfile             it will automatically start building up the image .  
            
In the last just curl the ip address of that container after running state. We will see the output which is mentioned in the index.html, we also host our own websites by just mentioning the code in index.html file.
